; bg-ophis.asm - Avik Das
;
; A very simple demo, based on the NES101 tutorial by Michael Martin.
; This demo can be assembled using Ophis, and runs on FCEUX.
; 
; This demo serves two purposes. Firstly, my goal is to learn NES
; development, which I can only achieve by creating a program.
; Secondly, the entirety of the program will be in one file, in order
; to show at a glance all the different parts of the program.
